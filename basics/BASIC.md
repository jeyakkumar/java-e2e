**JAVA Variables**

Java has three main types of variables based on where they are declared and their scope

*Local Variables*
    Declared within a method, constructor, or block. They are only accessible within that specific scope and do not have a default value, so they must be initialized before use

*Instance Variables*
    Declared within a class, but outside any method. Each object instance of the class gets its own copy of the variable. They have default values (e.g., 0 for numbers, false for booleans, null for object references).

*Class/Static Variables*
    Declared with the static keyword within a class. There is only one copy of this variable shared by all objects of the class. They are often used for constants.
